# Motivation

## Udacity Data Science Project

The default branch is for development of my Projet 1 release for the Udacity nanodegree program.

## The CRISP-DM analysis process will be followed.

- ### Business Understanding and a focus on 3 questions in particular:


#### Question 1: How does the total amount of suicides compare with the ratio of total suicides/100'000 (100k) per population?


#### Question 2: Is there any trend to see overall on a global scale considering macro-level playing fields?


#### Question 3: Who are the most and least countries contributing to the suicide ratio over time?


- ### Data Understanding in the Jupyter Notebook


- ### Evaluating the results


# Quick start

The following project includes data as an example to pursue data analysis.

The project is based on suicide overview rates from 1985-2015.

It contains data about a lot of countries grouped by different features such as sex, age group or GDP.

# File description

### The repository has the following information included:

- A Jupyter notebook about the current data analysis steps
- A README file
- A CSV file about the raw data

# How to interact

- You can take the CSV file and my Jupyter notebook as a first step into the analysis.
- Libraries used for the project:
  Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn

#### Further steps could include:

- More analysis based on socio-economic factors (HDI indicators) and economic factors (GDP)
- Apply machine learning on raw data to predict future paths for different countries e.g. based on facotrs above


# Summary



In the first part, you can see the overall trend of suicide rates was first increasing untill the 2000s and reversing afterwards which is a good sign.

The male contribution is over-proportionally higher than the female’s and this trend is consistent over time. Furthermore, the age range of +75 has the most impact on the suicide rate. 
In the last part, the lower tails give modest implications about the countries and its location, while the upper tails tell a story of possible iron curtail implications as quite a lot of cuntries of the former Soviet Union can be found on the list after it broke apart.




What has to be kept in mind of the shown analysis is that not all countries reported their numbers across the whole time range. There were at maximum around 90 countries in the dataset present and at minimum approximately 50 countries for each year of the study.

As a next action step for interested readers could be to consider the HDI data and the economic factors e.g. the GDP figures which are available in the dataset to conduct further analysis and gain more details.


I wrote a quick blog post on Medium where you can find my whole story and the higlighted steps are presented.
