# Motivation

## Udacity Data Science Project

The default branch is for development of my  Projet 1 release for the Udacity nanodegree program. 


# Quick start

The following project includes data as an example to do data analysis.

The project is based on suicide overview rates from 1985-2015.

It contains data about a lot of countries grouped by different features such as sex, age group, GDP.

# File description

### The repository has the following information included:

- A Jupyter notebook about the current data analysis steps
- A README file
- A CSV file about the raw data

# How to interact

- You can take the CSV file and my Jupyter notebook as a first step into the analysis.

#### Further steps could include:

- More analysis based on socio-economic factors (HDI indicators) and economic factors (GDP)
- Apply machine learning on raw data to predict future paths for different countries e.g. based on facotrs above
